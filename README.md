# Aether-Pulse
Players synchronize energy pulses (representing aether streams) on a grid by adjusting their frequencies (low, medium, high). Pulses decay over time, and matching frequencies in adjacent grid cells create harmonic links, earning points. The game progresses through phases, increasing pulse counts and complexity.
